# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a game of tic-tac-toe that consists of objects and 
factory functions that contain the players, gameboard, and X/O marker.
The logical process behind this application is to nest as many functions
as possible under one object, so it's easy and simple to pull out 
a function under said object and implement it into the game. If we used
separate functions in separate objects, it would just take more time and 
effort, and the code will take up more space. HTML and CSS are included
to allow the user to interact with the game in the most fluid and fun way 
possible.
